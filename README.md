# Human Induced Earthquakes

This is an exercise on visualizing and relating human-induced earthquakes
and the presence of oil wells in Oklahoma. <br>

While there are many misconceptions and nuances involved in the relationship
between fracking (hydraulic fracturing) and human-induced earthquakes, it is
widely accecpted that disposal of waste fluids that are a byproduct of oil production is the primary cause of the recent increase in earthquakes in the central United States. Learn more at https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/myths-and-misconceptions-about-induced-earthquakes 

## Relating Earthquakes in Oklahoma and Well Production

The GIF above shows the wells approved for drilling as well as the occurrences
of earthquakes over time and space in the state of Oklahoma. Note that prior to 2010s,
earthquakes are extremely rare. However, the proliferation of oil wells was
followed by the north and central Oklahoma.

The graph above shows the number of earthquakes and approval of oil wells. Note the
lag between the two variables.
